I’m a second-year [Machine Learning Ph.D. student](https://ml.gatech.edu/) in [Department of Computational Science and Engineering](https://cse.gatech.edu/) at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/). I am affiliated with AdityaLab and advised by [Dr. B Aditya Prakash](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~badityap/). My research focuses on time-series forecasting with various techniques, such as attention, causality, physics-regularization, and LLMs. These research results have made real-world influences such as Flu and COVID-19 forecasting challenges organized by CDC.

I am also interested in pre-trained foundation models and applications of LLMs in time series tasks. Previously, my research spanned physics-informed neural networks with the advice of [Prof. Aarti Singh](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aarti/) and federated learning under the advice of [Prof. Gauri Joshi](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/gaurij/) at Carnegie Mellon University.

My current research focus includes:
1. Learning performativity and causality representations for time-series forecasting;
2. Zero-shot time-series forecasting using LLMs and multi-modality large models;
3. Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization for time series.
